Following is the data flow description inside the application ref. design-architectural.png:
	>Here Main method act as Client which interact with Service/Business Layer and show the result on console.
	>From service layer the request will go to the DB Layer and here the JDBC connector will help to interact with the Database to perform the required operations.
	>Database having the category table (which already created by using the above script) when we perform any operation using JDBC then data will get resultSet object in DB Layer. 
	>At DB layer we are converting resultSet into List of Map of rows.
	>At service layer converting List of Map into JSON object and vice versa to get the request or to create the response, with the help of Google GSON API.
